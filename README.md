Data Science class project to detect anomalies

This project was to detect anomalies inside a dataset. 
I decided to use unsupervised learning to try and find anomalies to make it more difficult. 
I used three different learners to achieve this (Isolation forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One Class Support Vector).

Next, the dataset I used was of tweets that mentioned different companies.
For this I tried to determine the outliers of the mentions. 
By doing some manual analysis, I believe that I achieved some promising results with a Local Outlier Factor model.

I could have added more by, addding more features and by fine-tuning the model parameters to hone in on the best configurations for the data present.
